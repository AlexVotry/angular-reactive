# tutorial on reactive style Angular.

this Tutorial is from Udemy called `rxjs-reactive-angular-course`

there is a mock server used 
- npm run server

then start Angular
- npm start.

this course goes over using Observables with Rxjs using separate instances.

We start with Stateless observable and compare it to the imperative style (using the component to handle the logic)

Reactive style is more like the way React works. Using presentational components instead of smart components. 

Next is adding Loading and Error components with services. We can put the providers at different levels to provide separate instances of the component.
